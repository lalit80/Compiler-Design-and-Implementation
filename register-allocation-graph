order vertices in decreasing order of degree
pick highest and color it followed by coloring its neighbors
pick next highest until no more vertex left

for a vertex pick a color from (available - neighbors) and if empty assign a new color



available = {}
pick next vertex v of higher degree
	color(v)
	for each neighbor x of v
		color(x)

color()
	neighbors = color of its neighbors
	if (available -  neighbors) = {}
		get new color add it to available and color it to current vertex
	else if (available -  neighbors) != {}
		pick a color from the set and color it to current vertex
